# Dockerized Papermc Server
This repo offers paper minecraft servers prebuilt into a container so you don't have to install java, especially on arm systems since OpenJDK availability is extremely dependent on your distro.

## üöÄ Running
To run you can just use the [compose.yaml](/compose.yaml). It contains some script containers to fix permissions and accept the `eula.txt`.

Start it with `docker compose up -d`. The server will be available on `0.0.0.0:25565`.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è The container has no CLI interface!
#### Option 1
Edit the config files of the server and restart or (not recommended) `/reload` if you are already op-ed.

#### Option 2
Enable 'rcon' and use a client like [mcrcon](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon) to connect to the server console.

In the `server.properties` set the following values:

```properties
enable-rcon=true
...
rcon.password=my-s3cr3t-p4ssw0rd!
rcon.port=25575
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Other Versions
I have pre-build some versions for `arm64` and `amd64` architectures which are available in the [GitLab Container Registry](https://gitlab.com/PeeK1e/paper-server/container_registry/8600059).

Versions start from 1.24.1 but you can build older Versions too.

Head over to [papermc.io](https://papermc.io/downloads/all) and get the Download Link, paste it into the `compose.yaml` in the `PAPER_URL` param and rebuild the container with `docker compose build`.
